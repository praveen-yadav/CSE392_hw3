###Problem 2: Parallel MPI graph matching pseudo-algorithm with complexity.


###Problem 5: Parallel 2D n-body problem.

Parallel tree construction

1. Generate random points based on x- and y- ranges.
2. Generate Morton ids from coordinates of points.
3. Sort Morton ids.
4. Partition ids
5. Each thread builds local tree
6. nodes->ids (append level info)
7. remove duplicates
